#Overview

Cloudbreak is a RESTful Hadoop as a Service API. Once it is deployed in your favourite servlet container exposes a REST API allowing to span up Hadoop clusters of arbitrary sizes on your selected cloud provider. Provisioning Hadoop has never been easier. Cloudbreak is built on the foundation of cloud providers API (Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute...), Apache Ambari, Docker containers, Serf and dnsmasq.

Please note that we are also hosting (based on this Docker image) a Cloudbreal instance - which we maintan, support and continousely improve - based on your feedback. The hosted Cloudbreak is available here: 

SequenceIQ hosted Cloudbreak [instance](https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com/).

#Cloudbreak Docker container 

We are trying to ease your way to start Clousbreak and launch on-demand Hadoop clusters in the cloud. The easiest way to start with Cloudbreak is by starting it in  this Docker container. We have put together a fully configured and working Docker container - you will just have to set a few environment variables and you are ready to go.
